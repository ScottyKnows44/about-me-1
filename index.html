    <p> My name is Daniel and I am a happy father of 1 amazing little girl, her name is Cassie. I was born in Portland and raised in rural 
        Yamhill County in Oregon on a farm. I learned to play guitar at a young age and enjoy solving cryptograms. My family practically had a 
        zoo of animals growing up from cats and dogs to more unusual pets like Ricky, who was a raccoon. I moved to Washington in '08 and have
        enjoyed every last minute of our beautifully overcast rainy skys.
